# Vexin

**Vexin** is a sleek, powerful **Discord bot code management platform**.  
Built with **.tsx**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it enables users to:

- Manage their bot's code in real-time
- Push **live updates** without restarting
- (Soon) Extend functionality using a modular **plugin system**

> Note: Vexin is **not** a bot hosting platform â€” it's a **code manager**. Hosting may be introduced as a possible **premium feature** in the future.
